 1. It's a holder for an integer value from Register 1 (R1)

 2. CMPR Rn compareSigned Rn2 ex. i (R1) ?? n (R2) 
    ?? is defined as <, -, or >
    this assigns Rn  -1, 0, 1 respectively
    JMPP Rn > 0 ex. JMPP R1, endFOR
    JMPP looks to see if i (R1) holds the value 1
    if it does, jump to endFOR

 3. FALSE
 
 4. immediate addressing mode
 
 5. R1

 6. TRUE

 7. JMPN R0, endWHILE
    R0 represents the EOF and IF the input from the terminal
    in the previous line SVC #SVC_READ_FROM_TERMINAL is the EOF
    it will jump to the endWHILE label

 8. R1

 9. D: [0,25]

10. JMP is used to prevent executing the ELSE clause
